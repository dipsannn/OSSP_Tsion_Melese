## Introduction

The OSSP_Tsion_Melese project serves as a comprehensive guide for installing the IOS operating system. Additionally, it delves into the implementation of the `sigaction()` system call, which is essential for handling signals in Unix-like operating systems. This project aims to provide a clear understanding of both installation and implementation processes, making it accessible for developers and enthusiasts alike.

## Installation

To get started with the IOS installation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dipsannn/OSSP_Tsion_Melese.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**  
   Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd OSSP_Tsion_Melese
   ```

3. **Download Required Files**  
   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/dipsannn/OSSP_Tsion_Melese/releases) section to download the necessary files. Ensure to execute the files as per the instructions provided in the release notes.

4. **Follow the Installation Guide**  
   Refer to the installation guide included in the repository for detailed steps.

## Usage

Once you have installed IOS, you can start using it immediately. The implementation of the `sigaction()` system call allows you to manage signals effectively. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how to use it:

1. **Include Required Headers**  
   Make sure to include the necessary headers in your C program:

   ```c
   #include <signal.h>
   #include <stdio.h>
   ```

2. **Define Signal Handler**  
   Create a function that will handle the signals:

   ```c
   void signal_handler(int signal) {
       printf("Received signal: %d\n", signal);
   }
   ```

3. **Set Up sigaction**  
   Use `sigaction()` to set up the signal handler:

   ```c
   struct sigaction sa;
   sa.sa_handler = signal_handler;
   sigaction(SIGINT, &sa, NULL);
   ```

4. **Run Your Program**  
   Compile and run your program. Test the signal handling by sending signals (e.g., using Ctrl+C).

## Implementation Details

### Overview of `sigaction()`

The `sigaction()` function is a powerful tool in Unix-like operating systems for managing how your program responds to signals. It allows you to specify a signal handler that will execute when a specific signal is received.

### Key Features

- **Signal Handling**: Define custom behavior for signals like `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, etc.
- **Sa_mask**: Block certain signals while the handler is executing.
- **Sa_flags**: Control the behavior of the signal handling.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating the use of `sigaction()`:

```c
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void signal_handler(int signal) {
    printf("Caught signal %d\n", signal);
    exit(0);
}

int main() {
    struct sigaction sa;
    sa.sa_handler = signal_handler;
    sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);
    sa.sa_flags = 0;

    sigaction(SIGINT, &sa, NULL);

    printf("Press Ctrl+C to trigger the signal handler.\n");
    while (1) {
        sleep(1);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Testing the Implementation

To test the implementation, compile the program using:

```bash
gcc -o signal_example signal_example.c
```

Run the program and press Ctrl+C to see how the signal handler responds.
